                Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die.

                  How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death.

                  You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.
                  
                  Just you, sir? Don't worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.
                  
                  To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?
                  
                  I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
                  
                  Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?
                  
                  When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.
                  
                  You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.
                  
                  I told you I was immortal. Oh there are many forms of immortality.
                  
                  Oh, hee-hee, aha. Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha. And I thought my jokes were bad.
                  
                  But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.
                  
                  But we've met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin's, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don't remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do, move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy's home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It's like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that's all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I'd seen that look on your face before. It's the same one I taught myself. I don't why you took the fault for Dent's murder but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not...
                  
                  Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.
                  
                  The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act.
                  
                  Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.
                  
                  No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.
                  
                  Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
                  
                  All creatures feel fear. Especially the scary ones. 
                  
                  Does it come in black?
                  
                  You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil.
                  
                  Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe. What brings you out of the prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?
                  
                  Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.
                  
                  I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
                  
                  Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.
                  
                  I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.
                  
                  Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?
                  
                  You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.
                  
                  Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.
                  
                  The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.
                  
                  That's a lovely lovely voice!
                  
                  Swear to me!
                  
                  Your anger gives you great power. But if you Iet it, it will destroy you as it almost did me.
                  
                  It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.
                  
                  But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.
                  
                  I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.
                  
                  Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center, Wayne tower.
                  
                  It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.
                  
                  Look around you. You'll see two councilmen, a union official, couple off-duty cops and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear.
                  
                  Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.
                  
                  Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence, this cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening, I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca. I had this fantasy, that I would look across the tables and I would see you there with a wife maybe a couple of kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, nor me to you. But we would both know that you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you than that. I still do.
